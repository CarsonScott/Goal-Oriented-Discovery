# A Goal-Oriented Approach to Multi-Agent Knowledge Discovery

## Signals, Cooperation, and Sharing Knowledge

An agent is a knowledge-seeking system that stores and communicates information to/from a social environment, which is a network of communication lines that transmit signals between agents. If an agent does not recognize the information received as input, a new goal is created by the agent to obtain the missing knowledge.

It accomplished this by either searching its own memory for useful data, or by reaching out to the neighboring agents to see if they have access to the desired knowledge. The agent either receives the missing information from another agent, or some indication that the desired knowledge is not likely held by any agent in the surrounding regions.

## Goals, Competition, and Seeking Knowledge

An agent’s goals are fundamentally information-seeking in nature, which drives the agent to obtain knowledge that it does not already have. In other words, behavior is driven by the unknown, and actions are selected with respect to a utility function, which determines the expected payoff for an action. 

The payoff of a given action is equivalent to the predicted results of that action with respect to a set of goals, or desired information, that the agent is currently seeking. Thus an action will yield a higher payoff if it results in obtaining some desired information, and consequently the reduction of the associated drive which determines the perceived importance of that goal at any given time, with respect to all other active goals.

The goals that an agent chooses to pursue are selected using a competitive process, where each goal applies a suppressive force to the rest, in hopes of becoming the “most-active” goal and receiving the highest perceived importance from the agent, thus maximizing its own perceived priority and minimizing the priority of all other goals. 

## Feedback, Conformity, and Seeking Approval

Agents produce one-dimensional signals over time. An agent can alter the output signal via motors. Motors are convolution functions that are applied over the output signal when activated. Signals from other agents are observed by receivers that convert signals from other agents into data sets to be processed. An agent can alter the input signal via convolutional motors as well. 

The agents adapt their ability to construct sentences (signals) in order to communicate information between one another. An agent’s drive toward knowledge discovery manifests in the initial stage through stochastic exploratory behavior and constant feedback monitoring. 

Another drive that plays an important role at this stage is the power drive, which motivates the agent to exert control over its environment. This manifests as the desire for attention, which may be achieved by sending signals and observing feedback. The agent adaptively selects outputs that yield the highest amount of feedback from neighboring agents.


## Society, Norms, and Constructing Sentences

Specific input patterns can cause internal events to trigger within another agent. For example, the language-building system used to construct sentences may be triggered externally by another agent, whose signal patterns activate the receiving agent’s language system. An agent’s resistance to external signals is very weak at the initial stage but over time becomes stronger, resulting in an agent who’s highly self-driven and less influenced by the environment.

The system eventually conforms to a set of collectively-established behavioral norms. Conformity is essential to maintaining order within social systems. Conformity exerts a suppressive force on individuals that behave in a way that deviates from the social, political, or ideological standards of the society. These “taboo” individuals may pose a threat to the population itself, or it may pose a threat to the current stability/organization of the societal system, for instance the distribution of resources across various social classes within the population.
